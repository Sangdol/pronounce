The Pronounce
=========================================================================

A command line interface for English words pronunciation.
This program retrieves pronunciation files from the Meriam Webster
Online Dictionary which are publicly available to be downloaded
and plays them automatically.

This command downloads the pronunciation WAV files via "wget", stores them
locally in the "~/pronunciation.wavs" folder, and plays them via "ffplay".

=========================================================================
Usage
=========================================================================
Add the "pronounce" script to your path (for example, copy it in the
/usr/bin folder). Then run it as follows:
-------
Mode 1:   pronounce <word>
-------
To listen the default pronunciation of a word, for example "live", as
found on the Web, type:
  pronounce live
  
-------
Mode 2:   pronounce <word> <number>
-------
To listen the i-th available pronunciation of a word, for example the 2nd
pronunciation of "live" (which has different pronunciations as noun and
verb), type:
  pronounce live 2
  
-------
Mode 3:   pronounce <word> f
-------
To open the given word's definition page, e.g. live, in "firefox", type:
  pronounce live f
  
This mode, internally runs the following command:
  firefox "http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/live"
